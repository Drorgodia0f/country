# country

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andrewthad/country.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andrewthad/country)

This is a mega-repo with two projects:

- `country`: A library for dealing with countries, country codes, etc.
- `country-code-generation`: An executable that generates some of the
  source code in `country`. It converts both `countries.csv` and
  `aliases.txt` into lists of tuples.
